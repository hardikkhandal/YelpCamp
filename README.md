Dynamic camping platform allowing users to explore and share unique camping experiences. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Passport.js, EJS, and Express-session. User-friendly interfaces, secure authentication, and seamless data management with effective error handling 

YelpCamp is a full-stack web application that I developed to showcase my proficiency in various web technologies. It allows users to explore and share exotic camping sites from around the world. The project incorporates the following technologies and features:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and EJS (Embedded JavaScript templating engine).

Backend: Node.js, Express.js (a web application framework for Node.js), and MongoDB for data storage.

Authentication and Authorization: Implemented user authentication and authorization using Passport.js for secure login and access control.

CRUD Operations: Users can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on camping sites. This includes adding new sites, viewing existing ones, editing details, and removing sites.

User Reviews: Users have the ability to add reviews to camping sites, enhancing the community-driven nature of the platform.

Image Upload: Implemented a feature allowing users to upload images of their camping sites. This involved handling file uploads and storing file paths in the database.

Multi-User Interaction: Different users can interact with the platform independently, each having their own set of camping sites and reviews associated with their account.

Session Management: Utilized Express-session for managing user sessions, enabling the application to recognize and remember users across multiple requests.

Error Handling: Implemented robust error handling mechanisms to ensure smooth user experience and prevent application crashes.

Deployment: Deployed the application online, allowing users to access it seamlessly.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in full-stack web development and showcases my ability to create dynamic, interactive web applications with a focus on user experience and functionality.
